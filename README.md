    <p>Real-time Face Mask Detector using Webcam</p>
</h1>

This project is real-time face mask detection using webcam. 

It performs face mask detection and classification on the live cam stream using the FasterRCNN model trained on the [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection). Training and execution of CNN models is based on PyTorch.
Model architecture, model training, pipeline, etc. were referenced from other great resources. The codes referenced are summarized below.

- Capable of predicting muliple faces
- 3 types of results  

        ðŸŸ¢ with mask  
        ðŸŸ¡ mask weared incorrect  
        ðŸ”´ without mask 

## Objectives
Now that we live in the era of COVID-19, the importance of wearing a mask in our daily life has already been emphasized several times. According to a paper in the international journal Lancet, wearing a mask correctly can reduce the risk of infection by more than 85%.

So, we devised a Face Mask Detector. Based on Livecam, it automatically detects whether people are wearing masks or not. Thus, it can utilize to warn people who do not wear the mask or who use the mask improperly to wear it correctly.

## Data

- [Kaggle Face Mask Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection)
    - 853 pngs & xmls
    - approximately 7:4:1 for with mask, without mask, mask weared incorrect
 
- To resolve data imbalance between labels, we added additional images obtained by crawling.
    - add 180 **mask weared incorrect** pngs & xmls

## Method

- Model architecture: FasterRCNN
- The Number of traing epochs : 25
- Learning Rate : 1e-2
- Optimization method : SGD

    ```
2. Donwload data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection)

    * If you want to review data use `./src/data_review.ipynb`



4. Inference
    ```
    python inference.py --model "/your/trained/model/path/model.pth"
    ```


## Future works

- Long hair is recognized as a black mask 
- Accuracy varies with distance
